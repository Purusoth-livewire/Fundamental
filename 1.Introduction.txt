		Fundamental
		===========

Types of Language:
==================

1.high Level Language
2.Mid Level Language
3.Low Level Language


1.high Level Language:
======================
human communication Language(Tamil,english,hindi,etc.........)

2.Mid Level Language:
=====================
Translator.

Convert high level language into low level Language.
1.intrepreter
2.Compilers

 3.Low Level Language:
=====================
Machine known Language(binary values---bits 0 or 1).

program:
========
set of instruction to do a specific task.

			c programming
			=============

Introduction:
=============

Develaped by Dennis Ritchie.
when----1972 at AT&T BELL laboratories.

Influenced by CPL,BCPL,ALGOL,B Language.
CPL----Combined Programming Language
BCPL---Basic Combined Programming Language
B language

cpl,bcpl,B language are interpreter Langauge.


Interpreter:
============
Need to convert the high level into low level language.

before converting the program it need to check the program have any errors.

The interpreter will checks the error in line by line.
if there any error in a line it will stop the error checking process in that  line.
when the error was cleared then it will check next line.

c Language------compiler Language

Compiler:
=========
Need to convert the high level into low level Language.
before converting the program it needs to check the program have any errors.

once checks the whole program and display all errors.


Structure of C program:
=======================

Documention Section

preprocessor Directives(Header files)

return_type main()
{
 statements;
}


Documentation Section:
======================
we provide some details about program.

1.single line command(//):
==========================
	hide the details of that line.

2.Multi Line Command:(/*.......*/)
==================================

/*----starting before the details

	details

*/---after  ending the details



Basic Program:
==============

#include<stdio.h>
#include<conio.h>

void main()
{
  clrscr();

  printf("Livewire");

  getch();
}
